\section{Unstructured Meshes Concepts}
%
\label{s:concept}

The conservation element and solution element (CESE) method is developed
against the set-up of unstructured meshes in multi-dimensional
space\cite{mavriplis_unstructured_1997, wang_2d_1999}.  In contrast to
structured meshes, unstructured meshes allow flexible connectivity and simplex
elements.  The implementation, i.e., the data structures and the computer code
for their algorithms, of unstructured meshes dictate how simulation software
operates.  It serves two purposes: numerical methods for simulation and mesh
generation.  SOLVCON already includes code for the former and starts to plan
for the latter.

The library for unstructured meshes offers three functionalities:
%
\begin{enumerate}
%
\item Resource management: allocation, deallocation, and tracking.
%
\item Geometrical entity creation, read, update, and deletion (CRUD).
%
\item Spatial indexing.
%
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data Store}
%
\label{s:storage}

Most operations on meshes done by the simulation are reading.  The mesh is
usually assumed to be constant.  Numerical methods may use moving meshes, but
it is an advanced topic that should be treated separately.

SOLVCON uses a set of lookup tables to store the unstructured mesh.  The
technique is commonly seen in unstructured-mesh solvers for the efficient
memory use.  The CESE method is finite-volume-based and associates variables
with volume centers.  The data store optimizes for easily reading values for
discrete volume, and thus defines \textit{cell}, \textit{face}, and
\textit{node}.  Cells are the discrete volume for the space of interest.  Faces
are the interface between two cells.  Nodes represent the coordinates in space.
A mesh is also a Voronoi diagram, and the ``cell'' is a \textit{Voronoi
cell}\cite{berg_computational_2010}.  At this point, it's not straight-forward
why the three concepts are fundamental to the CESE method.  It may be revealed
in detail discussions later.

SOLVCON allows mixing elements of different shapes.  The mesh definition data
are are listed in Table~\ref{t:elm:meta}, \ref{t:subent1d}, \ref{t:subent2d},
\ref{t:subent3d} and Figure~\ref{f:elm2d}, \ref{f:elm3d}.  The code for
unstructured meshes in SOLVCON has been organized to a C++ library
\href{https://github.com/solvcon/solvcon/tree/master/libmarch}{\texttt{libmarch}}.

\section{The CESE Method Dual Mesh}
\label{s:cese_dual}

Figure~\ref{f:mesh_2d_tri} exhibits 6 triangular mesh elements for the CESE
method.  The CESE method evaluates the solutions at geometrical centers of
conservation elements (CEs) and constructs the solution elements (SEs).  The
element centers and the mesh vertices consist of the conservation elements.
See Fig.~\ref{f:mesh_2d_ce}.
